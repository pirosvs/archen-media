## Description
Social media allows people to talk to each other whenever they have access to the internet. This project creates a social media clone that allows users to friend one another to keep tabs on people they like, make posts (thoughts) to express what they're feeling, and react to other's posts to communicate with each other. This creates the setup to allow users to communicate with whoever they want whenever they can through our thought-reaction system. We keep things casual by limiting characters, lending the app more to sharing brief life updates or passing thoughts and emotions than long theoretical pieces.

This project uses MongoDB and mongoose to run a basic API, using our models to sort out what kind of data to store in our tables and what tables we need, our controllers to create the methods to find, add, update, and delete this information, and our routes to state how to call upon those methods, and our server and connection to open it up for use.
